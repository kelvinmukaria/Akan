Akan Name Assigner
 This is a web application that takes a user's birthday and calculates the day of the week they were born and then depending on their gender outputs their Akan Name. 

Description
Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week a child is born, and on the gender of the child. This name assigner takes a user's birthdate and gender information, and outputs an Akan name.
